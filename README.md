## Welcome Aboard 🤝

**OLLO Station** is a trading platform, network, and sovereign L1 chain built on [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com) and the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk), providing next-gen trading tools and sustainable [tokenomics](https://docs.ollo.zone/about/tokenomics). Our all-in-one decentralized exchange platform will provide a diverse suite of advanced, automated tools that go beyond the basic capabilities of order book trading, staking, bonding, and portfolio control.

We're working to provide users with **full control and automation** over their assets, positions, stakes, bonds and rewards throughout the Cosmos ecosystem and beyond. We are professional traders, developers, DeFi scientists and dedicated individuals focused on continuous & sustainable DeFi innovation. Our philosophy is built on the idea that the best tools of today are just a glimpse into the possibilities of tomorrow.

Currently, we're in the testnet phase of our development. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pVCk6BDS) or follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OLLOStation) account for updates.
